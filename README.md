# Lasius open-source time tracking

Lasius is an open source time tracking solution that includes a comprehensive set of features, with a particular focus on team collaboration.

**Public Beta**: We welcome your feedback! Please use the issue tracker of this repository.

Lasius is a modern web application with a backend written in Scala and a NextJS React frontend.

# Features

# History

The development of Lasius started in 2015. It is the exclusive time tracking tool of Tegonal, an experienced software development team based in Bern (Switzerland). We developed Lasius because there was no tool available in 2015 and, to be honest, because we just wanted to build something new and nice :-)

Our time tracker had to be based on open source components, meet our high privacy standards and be able to be hosted wherever we wanted. The feature set of Lasius has been continuously adapted to our needs in everyday project work and we are happy that we can share it with you.

# Development 
## Requirements

* mongoDB >= 5.0.9

## Environment Variables

This is only necessary if you sping up the containers manually or with your own compose file. For your convenience,
check out the [lasius-docker-compose](https://github.com/tegonal/lasius-docker-compose) companion repo.
Please see the `docker-compose.yml` file for container specific environment variables.

The following variables are suggested to be used in an `.env` file alongside docker-compose and could be used by all
containers, containing secrets that only might be available during CI/CD.

We suggest you use a `.env` file and save it in the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml` for build dependent configuration and edit all other variables in the `docker-compose.yml` file directly if they are not dependent on CI/CD variables.

## Dev Environment

To bring up a local dev Environment please install:

- sbt
- docker
- node

Copy the frontent `frontend/.env.template` file to `frontend/.env.local`.

Start the backend with `yarn run backend` and the frontend with `yarn run dev` from the `frontend` directory.

## Test Environment

To simply bring up a test environment, check out
the [lasius-docker-compose](https://github.com/tegonal/lasius-docker-compose) companion repo.

## Production Environment

To bring up a production environment, check out
the [lasius-docker-compose](https://github.com/tegonal/lasius-docker-compose) companion repo.

The docker-compose setup above comes with single mongoDB instance and therefore without support of transactions. To use Lasius in production, you should use transactions and therefore run mongoDB in a replicaset. To benefit from transactions in Mongo DB you need to set `LASIUS_SUPPORTS_TRANSACTIONS=true` and configure an external access to the mongodb replicaset through `MONGODB_URI`.

Lasius' docker-compose.yml supports LetsEncrypt certificates out of the box, thanks to Traefik reverse proxy. If you decide to run Lasius behind another reverse proxy or SSL termination point, you can look at `docker-compose-no-https.yml`. However, we strongly suggest using secure connections.
